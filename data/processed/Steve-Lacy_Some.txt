Baby, I want some of your love
Your love, your love, your love
Baby, can I have some of your loveYour love, your love, your love

I know there′s lots of love in your heart
But, who you gonna give it to?
Oh-oh-oh, I'm sure there′s lots guys that you see
But, I swear they are not as cool as me
Girl I can take you where you wanna go
If you wanna run, we watch a movie
Hit the beach, or just chill and get high
And we can do whatever you wanna do

Baby, I want some of your love
Your love, your love, your love
Baby, can I have some of your love
Your love, your love, your love
